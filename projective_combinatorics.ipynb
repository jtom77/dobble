    "# Constructing a Dobble card set\n",
    "\n",
    "Every card of a Dobble game contains a fixed number $n$ of symbols. The set of cards is defined by the rules\n",
    "\n",
    "1. any two cards have exactly one symbol in common\n",
    "2. any two symbols appear together on exactly one card\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that these requirements have an exact geometrical analogue. In two-dimensional affine geometry, the following two rules hold:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. any two non-parallel lines meet in exactly one point\n",
    "2. any two points lie on exactly one line\n",
    "\n",
    "Since these characteristics depend only on the underlying vector-space, they particularly hold for vector-spaces over *finite fields* $\\mathbb{F}_q$ with $q$ elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "So the strategy to construct a Dobble card game is as follows. Associate \"card\" with \"line\" and \"symbol\" with \"point\" and consider the affine plane over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, construct every line in the finite affine plane $A(\\mathbb{F}_q)$. Consider therefore that every line is defined by an equation\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\mathbf{w}\\cdot\\mathbf{x} + b = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "for $\\mathbf{w} \\in A(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ and $b\\in \\mathbb{F}_q$. This means that every line is defined by a tuple $(\\mathbf{w}, b)$ where $\\mathbf{w}$ ranges over all different \"directions\" of the vector space. The different directions $\\mathbf{w}_i$ can be given by the set of $q+1$ representatives \n",
    "$$\n",
    "    (0,1)^T, (1,0)^T, (1,2)^T, \\ldots, (1,n-1)^T,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "and the offsets $b_j$ are all $q$ elements of $\\mathbb{F}_q$. It follows from basic linear algebra that the lines $(\\mathbf{w}_i, b_j)$ define all the lines in $A(\\mathbb{F}_q)$. \n",
    "This makes up for a total of $q^2 + q$ different lines in $A(\\mathbb{F}_q)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two different lines intersect in exactly one point if they are not parallel, i.e. they have different direction vectors. "
